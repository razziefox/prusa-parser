## Prusa Parser
Parser that parses information from webhooks generated by Prusa Connect. While this library was made for Google App Scripts in mind, this will work on any platform that uses vanilla javascript.

## Background
The initial idea came from needing to collect information on what prints where being done with Google App Scripts, but the current state of Prusa Connect API is rather primitive currently. For now, this parser exists to collect data from webhook notifications generated by Prusa Connect. I hope someday this library is no longer needed.
